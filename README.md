Video Frame Picker (React Native)

------------------------------

<code>**Live Demo**: </code>

This is an example React Native application in which a picker/scrubber component is created that allows to select a frame from a video by scrubbing through all of the image frames of the video, which is similar to the cover frame picker screen in Instagram while uploading a video, that asks you to select an image from the video to be treated as the cover/thumbnail of the video. 

So, the Video Frame Picker is built as a replica of that screen. The technologies used to build this app are **React Native**, **TypeScript**, **Expo**, **XCode**, **React Hooks**. This app is specifically tested on **iOS** and the most highlighted library used to build it is **[react-native-ffmpeg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-ffmpeg)**. The features of this app are:

- Get your React Native development environment ready, following the docs here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup (skip if already done).
- Run command <code>yarn install</code> on the root directory of Video Frame Picker (React Native) App to install the node packages.
- This example app is specifically tested on iOS, so make sure your iOS setup for React Native (including Xcode, Simulator, CocoaPods etc.) is ready. After that:
- Run <code>cd ios</code>
- Run <code>pod install</code>
- Run <code>open videoframepickerreactnative.xcworkspace</code>
- Run <code>cd ..</code> (to move back to root directory)
- Run the App by running the command <code>expo start --dev-client -c</code> on the root directory.
- If all goes well, you will see the app running in your iOS Simulator.
